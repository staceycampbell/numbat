This project started as a simple mental exercise to code some common chess algorithms in
[Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog). At some point these snippets
morphed into an attempt to write a full chess playing program in C and Verilog.

Verilog is one of the two popular [Hardware Description Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language).
It is used to create digital circuits to be deployed on an [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)
or [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array).

I am not a chess player and had to spend considerable time making sure I knew the
rules of chess before I started coding. From there I read many lines of C code, several
wikis, and several forums dedicated to traditional (non-[neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)))
chess algorithms.

As such I'd like to acknowledge and thank the following for their work in expanding knowledge in this area:
